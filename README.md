# Mythic Boss Notes

**Mythic Boss Notes** is a lightweight, elegant note‑taking addon for Mythic+ dungeons and raids.  
It gives you a clean, resizable window where you can write:

- Dungeon‑level notes (routes, affixes, trash plans)
- Boss‑specific notes (mechanics, cooldown plans, assignments)
- Quick reminders for pugs or guild groups

Designed for speed, clarity, and zero clutter.
